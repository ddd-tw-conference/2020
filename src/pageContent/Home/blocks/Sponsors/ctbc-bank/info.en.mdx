Established in 1966, CTBC Bank has been building customers’ wealth and Taiwan’s economy for decades. In that time, it has grown into an international force offering a comprehensive suite of financial services.

Guided by the business principles of integrity and caring, our Bank has a proud history punctuated by regular achievements and innovative services. From issuing the first credit card in Taiwan to setting up the first customer service center of any bank in the country, we have led the way in the financial industry’s digital transformation, particularly by promoting the digitalization of business processes. As of the end of 2019, the Bank’s consolidated assets totaled NT\$4.23 trillion, the most among all privately owned banks in Taiwan. It is also the best-performing bank in other indicators, such as profits, tier 1 capital, and client base.

In addition to its 152 branches nationwide, CTBC Bank has the most extensive international presence of any Taiwanese bank, with 116 overseas branches across 14 countries and regions. Having purchased a subsidiary, The Tokyo Star Bank, in Japan and having established CTBC Bank subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, the Philippines, and Indonesia, the Bank has laid a strong foundation for regional business, providing international enterprises with comprehensive transnational financial services. Furthermore, in support of the Taiwanese government’s New Southbound Policy, the Bank has proactively expanded its South and Southeast Asian business in recent years by leveraging its existing branches in Vietnam, India, and Singapore. It is also the first financial institution in Taiwan to have acquired a stake in a local Thai operator, LH Financial Group. In Greater China, the Bank is committed to cultivating business in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, with Shanghai at the heart of its expansion into the Chinese market. Together, these advances abroad are providing our customers with a more convenient and comprehensive service network.

Looking ahead, we plan to continue optimizing our international service network as well as to provide our customers with even more convenient global services. We will also continue to expand our efforts in operational performance, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and environmental sustainability as we cement our status as “Taiwan Champion, Asia Leader.”
