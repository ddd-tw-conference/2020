A lot of knowledge is lost when designing and building software â€” lost because of hand-overs in a telephone game, confusing communication by not having a shared language, discussing complexity without visualisation and by not leveraging the full potential and wisdom of the people. That lost knowledge impacts the sustainability, quality and value of the software product being built. Kenny blends IT approaches like Domain-Driven Design and Continuous Delivery with visual collaboration tools, Cynefin framework and Deep Democracy. With that socio-technical mindset, Kenny Baas-Schwegler empowers and collaboratively facilitates organisations, teams and people in designing and building sustainable quality software products.

One of Kenny's core principles is sharing knowledge. He does that by writing a blog on his website baasie.com and helping curate the Leanpub book visual collaboration tool. Besides writing he is also active in the Domain-Driven Design community as an organiser of Virtual Domain-Driven Design (virtualddd.com) and Domain Driven Design Nederland and as a public speaker is giving talks and hands-on workshops at conferences and meetups.
