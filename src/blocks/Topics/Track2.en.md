# Track 2: Technical Implementation

- Have you ever encountered massive problems with non-functional requirements of architectural designs and functional requirements of business logic during software development?
- Do you still build up more technical debt while doing rapid iterative tasks to satisfy the high growth of the business?
- If we choose an inappropriate design pattern and architecture at a bad time, the maintenance burden rises.
- Facing the trade-off between lack of design and over-design, we have to understand what to choose and what to abandon under different scenarios.
- Including:
  1. Several application scenarios using DDD tactics.
  2. Topics for DDD architecture design.
  3. Relevant design patterns.
